# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the Analysis:

PyBer, a rude-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion, and we were tasked with analyzing all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize. For the below analysis we created a summary Data frame of the data by city type and a multiple-line graph that show the total weekly fares for each city type.

# Results:

Based on the below chart, I outlined the ride sharing data within the different city types:
-	Urban cities seem to be the most popular city for Pyber users.
- Total Rides:
  - The Urban cities rank #1. It is actually has more than 2x more riders than the Suburban cities, which ranks #2.
- Total Drivers:
  -The Urban cities (again) rank #1 with more than 5xs more drivers than the other cities. 
- Total Fares:
  - Obviously since Urban cities had the most Rides and Drivers, it makes sense that it had the most Total Fares as compared to the other cities.
- Avg. Fare per Ride:
  - Although it ranked the lowest in the other categories, Rural cities came in #1 for the Avg. Fare per Ride at $34.62. 
- Avg. Fare per Driver:
  - Rural cities also had the highest Avg. Fare per driver as compared to the other two cities.

# Summary:

Based on the Data above, I would recommend:
1.	Moving some drivers that are in the Urban cities to the Rural areas or maybe just hiring more. There are more than triple drivers in the Urban cities so I donâ€™t think it would hurt moving some drivers over.
2.	Looking at the data, we can see that drivers in rural cities are earning more than drivers in urban cities. This could discourage potential drivers from working with PyBer given the low average fare per driver.
3.	The data shows that the Avg. Fare per ride is much higher compared to the other cities, which could indicate that they are traveling further than the Urban riders.
